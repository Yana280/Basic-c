##Printing Hello World and using int char and float data types
printf statement prints the string "hello world!" as an output
 \n at the end is used to print on a new line. 
 The %d format specifier is used with the printf function, it tells printf to expect an integer argument, and to replace the %d with the integer.
 Similiarly, %c format specifier is used to add a character and %f format specifier is used to add a floating point number(float).
 The main function returns the value 0, which is a convention to indicate that the program executed successfully.![Screenshot (216)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125993593/230716229-263a61e9-45d2-49db-a3ce-1d26ee07d1f3.png)
